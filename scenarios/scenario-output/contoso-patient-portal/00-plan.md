## 💬 Prompt

```text
Design a HIPAA-compliant patient portal for Contoso Healthcare.

Business Requirements:
- 10,000 active patients need secure access to medical records
- 50 clinical and administrative staff users
- Appointment scheduling and messaging features
- Must meet HIPAA compliance (BAA required)
- 99.9% uptime SLA minimum

Technical Requirements:
- Web frontend for patients (mobile-responsive)
- REST API backend (.NET 8)
- Patient data database with encryption
- Secure document storage
- Audit logging for compliance

Constraints:
- Budget: $800/month maximum
- Region: swedencentral (default) or germanywestcentral
- 3-month implementation timeline
- Team has Azure experience but limited IaC expertise
- Prefer managed services over IaaS
```

## ✅ Output

# Contoso Healthcare Patient Portal - Deployment Plan

Deploy a HIPAA-compliant patient portal using Azure PaaS services in `swedencentral`. The architecture uses
App Service for the .NET 8 API, Azure SQL with encryption at rest, Key Vault for secrets management, and
comprehensive audit logging—all secured via private endpoints and managed identities.

## Business Requirements Summary

| Requirement  | Target                     |
| ------------ | -------------------------- |
| Users        | 10,000 patients + 50 staff |
| Availability | 99.9% SLA                  |
| Compliance   | HIPAA (BAA required)       |
| Budget       | $800/month max             |

## Recommended Azure Services

| Component          | Service                      | SKU           | Rationale                           |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Patient Portal API | Azure App Service            | P1v3          | HIPAA BAA covered, VNet integration |
| Patient Database   | Azure SQL Database           | S1 (20 DTU)   | Encryption at rest, Azure AD auth   |
| Secrets Management | Azure Key Vault              | Standard      | HSM-backed secrets, HIPAA compliant |
| Audit Logging      | Log Analytics + App Insights | Pay-as-you-go | 90-day retention for compliance     |
| Document Storage   | Azure Blob Storage           | LRS           | Encryption, private endpoint        |

## Network Architecture

| Tier              | Subnet                         | Resources                          | Security           |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------ |
| Web               | `snet-web-prod` (10.0.1.0/24)  | App Service (VNet integrated)      | NSG: HTTPS only    |
| Data              | `snet-data-prod` (10.0.2.0/24) | SQL, Key Vault (private endpoints) | NSG: From web only |
| Private Endpoints | `snet-pe-prod` (10.0.3.0/24)   | Private endpoints                  | No public access   |

---

## Security Considerations (HIPAA)

1. **Access Controls** — Azure AD authentication, RBAC for least privilege
2. **Encryption at Rest** — Azure SQL TDE, Storage service encryption
3. **Encryption in Transit** — TLS 1.2+ enforced on all endpoints
4. **Audit Logging** — All access logged to Log Analytics (90 days)
5. **Private Endpoints** — No public access to data tier
6. **Managed Identities** — No credentials in code/config
7. **Key Vault** — All secrets centrally managed

## Estimated Monthly Costs

| Service                | Estimated Cost (USD) |
| ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| App Service (P1v3)     | ~$146                |
| Azure SQL (S1, 20 DTU) | ~$30                 |
| Key Vault              | ~$3                  |
| Storage (100 GB)       | ~$5                  |
| Log Analytics (5 GB)   | ~$15                 |
| Application Insights   | Included             |
| Private Endpoints (×2) | ~$15                 |
| **Total Estimate**     | **~$214/month**      |

> ✅ **Well under $800 budget** — Room for staging environment or additional features

## Open Questions for Next Step

1. **Document Storage** — Azure Blob or Azure Files for medical documents?
2. **Authentication** — Azure AD B2C for patients or Azure AD only?
3. **Disaster Recovery** — Add geo-replication to germanywestcentral?
