# Workload Documentation Standards

Guidelines for generating comprehensive Azure workload documentation that synthesizes
IaC artifacts into customer-deliverable design documents, operational runbooks, and
compliance artifacts.

## Document Purpose

Workload documentation serves as:

- **Customer deliverables** for consulting engagements and project handovers
- **Operational reference** for day-2 operations teams
- **Compliance evidence** for audits and regulatory requirements
- **Knowledge preservation** for long-term maintainability

---

## Source Artifact Integration

### Required Sources

Documentation must be synthesized from existing agentic workflow outputs:

| Source                 | Location                           | Content to Extract                               |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| WAF Assessment         | `02-architecture-assessment.md`    | Business context, pillar scores, recommendations |
| Cost Estimate          | `03-des-cost-estimate.md`          | Monthly/annual costs, SKU rationale              |
| Implementation Plan    | `04-implementation-plan.md`        | Resource specs, dependencies, phases             |
| Governance Constraints | `04-governance-constraints.md`     | Azure Policy requirements                        |
| Bicep Code             | `infra/bicep/{project}/`           | Resource definitions, parameters, outputs        |

### Optional Sources

| Source           | Location                | Content to Extract                          |
| ---------------- | ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Design Diagram   | `03-des-diagram.png`    | Pre-implementation architecture             |
| As-Built Diagram | `07-ab-diagram.png`     | Deployed architecture                       |
| ADRs             | `*-adr-*.md`            | Decision rationale, alternatives considered |

### Integration Rules

1. **Reference, don't duplicate** - Link to existing documents rather than copying content
2. **Extract and summarize** - Pull key data points, summarize for appropriate audience
3. **Maintain traceability** - Always cite source artifacts
4. **IaC is source of truth** - Resource details come from Bicep, not assumptions

---

## File Naming Conventions

All workload documentation files use `07-` prefix:

| File                        | Purpose                                  | Required |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `07-documentation-index.md` | Master index of all documentation        | Yes      |
| `07-design-document.md`     | Comprehensive 10-section design document | Yes      |
| `07-operations-runbook.md`  | Day-2 operational procedures             | Yes      |
| `07-resource-inventory.md`  | Complete resource listing from IaC       | Yes      |
| `07-compliance-matrix.md`   | Security controls and compliance mapping | Optional |
| `07-backup-dr-plan.md`      | Backup and disaster recovery procedures  | Optional |

2. **Daily Operations** - Health checks, log review
3. **Routine Maintenance** - Weekly/monthly tasks, patching
4. **Incident Response** - Severity definitions, common issues
5. **Scaling Procedures** - Scale up/down procedures
6. **Deployment Procedures** - Standard, emergency, rollback
7. **Contact Information** - On-call, escalation paths

### Best Practices

- Include actual commands and scripts where helpful
- Use severity levels consistently (Sev 1-4)
- Provide step-by-step procedures, not just descriptions
- Include rollback procedures for every deployment step

---

## Resource Inventory Standards

### Structure

1. **Summary** - Resource counts by category
2. **Resource Listing** - Tables by resource type
3. **IP Address Allocation** - Complete IP mapping
4. **Dependencies** - Mermaid diagram showing relationships
5. **Tags Applied** - Tag values per resource

### Extraction from Bicep

Parse Bicep files to extract:

```bicep
// Extract resource type, name, SKU, location
resource appService 'Microsoft.Web/sites@2023-12-01' = {
  name: appServiceName        // → Name column
  location: location          // → Location column
  sku: { name: 'P1v3' }       // → SKU column
  // ...
}
```

### Dependency Mapping

Generate Mermaid diagrams from Bicep dependencies:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Resource Group"
        VNet[Virtual Network] --> Subnet[Subnet]
        Subnet --> NSG[Network Security Group]
        Subnet --> AppService[App Service]
        AppService --> KeyVault[Key Vault]
        AppService --> Storage[Storage Account]
    end
```
